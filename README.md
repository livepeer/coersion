# coersion
prototype for video content validation

## To run the app
```shell
git clone https://github.com/mkrufky/coersion
cd coersion
docker-compose up
```

...then navigate to http://localhost:8080

This, right now, is only a demonstration of the demonstration itself.  As such, it currently only has the ability to extract a still image and scale it.

To try out this feature, use the `scale` endpoint and provide three arguments:

s - a link to a video source
w - a desired width dimension for resizing
h - a desired height dimension for resizing

This repository will be updated as the POC progresses...
